/*
On average, it took 10% of teacher registrations in the District to sign the 1st 5 schools
District X currently has 2 schools under contract and that district has had 20 silvers total (including those that are B2B Type today). Therefore, the guidance is that we need to create another 80 Silvers in that District. 

Approach:
Districts with 5 or more schools under contract
Tag each district as large, medium or small
Date when they got the 5th School 
By that date, how many silvers did they have?


Current Districts with more than 5 schools, but less than 5 Schools with contract
Tag each as Large, medium or small
Current amount of Silvers
